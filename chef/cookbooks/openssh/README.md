openssh Cookbook
================
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/openssh.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/opscode-cookbooks/openssh)

Installs openssh.


Requirements
------------
### Platform
- Debian/Ubuntu
- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific
- Fedora
- ArchLinux
- FreeBSD


Recipes
-------
### default
Selects the packages to install by package name and manages the sshd service.

### iptables
Set up an iptables firewall rule to allow inbound SSH connections.


Usage
-----
Ensure that the openssh packages are installed and the service is managed with `recipe[openssh]`.


Attributes List
---------------
The attributes list is dynamically generated, and lines up with the default openssh configs.

This means anything located in [sshd_config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5) or [ssh_config](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5) can be used in your node attributes.

* If the option can be entered more then once, use an _Array_, otherwise, use a _String_. If the option is host-specific use a `Hash` (please see below for more details).
* Each attribute is stored as ruby case, and converted to camel case for the config file on the fly.
* The current default attributes match the stock `ssh_config` and `sshd_config` provided by openssh.
* The namespace for `sshd_config` is `node['openssh']['server']`.
* Likewise, the namespace for `ssh_config` is `node['openssh']['client']`.
* An attribute can be an `Array`, a `Hash` or a `String`.
* If it is an `Array`, each item in the array will get it's own line in the config file.
* `Hash` attributes are meant to used with `ssh_config` namespace to create host-specific configurations. The keys of the `Hash` will be used as the `Host` entries and their associated entries as the configuration values.
* All the values in openssh are commented out in the `attributes/default.rb` file for a base starting point.
* There is one special attribute name, which is `match`. This is not included in the default template like the others. `node['openssh']['server']['match']` must be a Hash, where the key is the match pattern criteria and the value should be a Hash of normal keywords and values. The same transformations listed above apply to these keywords. See examples below.


Dynamic ListenAddress
---------------------
Pass in a `Hash` of interface names, and IP address type(s) to bind sshd to. This will expand to a list of IP addresses which override the default `node['openssh']['server']['listen_address']` value.


Examples and Common usage
-------------------------
These can be mixed and matched in roles and attributes.  Please note, it is possible to get sshd into a state that it will not run.  If this is the case, you will need to login via an alternate method and debug sshd like normal.

#### No Password logins

This requires use of identity files to connect

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "password_authentication": "no"
  }
}
```

#### Match

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "match": {
      "Address 192.168.1.0/24": {
        "password_authentication": "yes"
      },
      "Group admins": {
        "permit_tunnel": "yes",
        "max_sessions": "20"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Enable X Forwarding

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "x11_forwarding": "yes"
  }
}
```

####  Bind to a specific set of address (this example actually binds to all).

Not to be used with `node['openssh']['listen_interfaces']`.

```json
"openssh": {
  "server": {
    "address_family": "any",
      "listen_address": [ "192.168.0.1", "::" ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Bind to the addresses tied to a set of interfaces.

```json
"openssh": {
  "listen_interfaces": {
    "eth0": "inet",
    "eth1": "inet6"
  }
}
```

### Host-specific configurations with hashes.
You can use a `Hash` with `node['openssh']['client']` to configure different values for different hosts.

```json
"client": {
  "*": {
    "g_s_s_a_p_i_authentication": "yes",
    "send_env": "LANG LC_*",
    "hash_known_hosts": "yes"
  },
  "localhost": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  },
  "127.0.0.1": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  },
  "other*": {
    "user_known_hosts_file": "/dev/null",
    "strict_host_key_checking": "no"
  }
}
```

The keys are used as values with the `Host` entries. So, the configuration fragment shown above generates:

```text
Host *
SendEnv LANG LC_*
HashKnownHosts yes
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
Host localhost
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Host 127.0.0.1
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
Host other*
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```
