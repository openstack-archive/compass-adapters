Enables rrdcached on the gmetad server.\n* `node['ganglia']['enable_two_gmetads']` - Default false. Setting to true runs two copies of gmetad on the server; one writes out RRDs and the web UI talks to the other. This improves web UI performance for large installations.\n* `node['ganglia']['spoof_hostname']` - Default false. Setting to true configures gmond to force the use of its hostname as the node name rather than the default ganglia behavior of using reverse DNS. Useful for cloud environments such as EC2.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTerminology: the ganglia `grid` is made up of multiple `clusters`, each `cluster` has multiple `hosts`. It is common to group hosts by function or some other useful designation into a cluster.\n\nAdding the default recipe to your runlist will install gmond. This recipe should be included on all nodes in your grid to get ganglia to graph metrics for them.\n\nThere should be one or more hosts running under the role indicated by `node['ganglia']['server_role']`; these hosts will serve as the web UI and central collection point for all your metrics. It should run at least the ganglia::gmetad and ganglia::web recipes. It may also run the ganglia::gmond_collector recipe if you have multiple clusters in your grid.  Adding the ganglia::graphite recipe will enable graphite monitoring in addition to the standard ganglia graphing.\n\nThe aggregator recipe will install aggregator.py and run it every minute from cron. The aggregation recipe should be run on the same node as runs your gmond collectors. It will look for attributes set in other recipes indicating what metrics to aggregate and how to aggregate them. It will connect ot each of the collector gmond processes, get all the relevant metrics, aggregate them, and re-submit them to the same gmond under the pseudo-host \"all_${clustername}\".\n\nLWRP\n====\n\ngmetric\n-------\n\nInstalls a gmetric plugin.\n\nThe plugin is composed of two templates:\n* One for the script\n* One for the cron job that will call the script\n\nThe templates must be in the caller cookbook.\n\nExample:\n\n    ganglia_gmetric 'memcache' do\n        options :port => 11211\n    end\n\n    templates:\n    cookbooks/memcache/templates/default/memcache.gmetric.erb\n    cookbooks/memcache/templates/default/memcache.cron.erb\n\nThe content of 'options' will be passed to the templates\n\nlogtailer\n---------\n\nThe logtailer LWRP makes it easy to configure the ganglia-logtailer package with a custom module to consume a log file and report statistics to ganglia. If you are using one of the modules that came with ganglia-logtailer (look in /usr/share/ganglia-logtailer), don't use the LWRP - instead create a crontab entry in your recipe.\n\nIn order to use the logtailer from cron or the LWRP, you must\n* build and install the ganglia-logtailer package from https://github.com/ganglia/ganglia_contrib/tree/master/ganglia-logtailer\n* include the ganglia::logtailer recipe on the node that will use the LWRP\n\nWhen using the LWRP, you must include the python ganglia-logtailer module you want to use in a directory called 'ganglia' in the calling cookbook's templates dir.\n\nFor example, if my cookbook configures and installs nginx and I wish to use the ganglia-logtailer with a custom nginx module I would:\n* put the following LWRP invocation in the nginx recipe:\n include_recipe \"ganglia::logtailer\"\n ganglia_logtailer \"NginxLogtailer\" do\n   action :enable\n   log_file \"/var/log/nginx/access.log\"\n end\n* place the python module in mynginx/templates/ganglia/NginxLogtailer.py.erb\n\npython\n------\n\nInstalls a python plugin.\n\nThe plugin is composed of two templates:\n* One for the python module\n* One for the configuration of the module\n\nThe templates must be in the caller cookbook.\n\nExample:\n\n    ganglia_python 'memcache' do\n        options :port => 11211\n    end\n\n    templates:\n    cookbooks/memcache/templates/default/memcache.py.erb\n    cookbooks/memcache/templates/default/memcache.pyconf.erb\n\nThe content of 'options' will be passed to the templates\n\nCaveats\n=======\n\nThis cookbook has been tested on Ubuntu 12.\n\nSearch seems to takes a moment or two to index.\nYou may need to converge again to see recently added nodes.\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis cookbook is set up to test using\n* knife test\n* foodcritic\n* chefspec\n* test-kitchen with minitest\n\nTo launch all the tests, run:\n* bundle install\n* bundle exec strainer test\n\nFor individual tests, examine the Strainerfile for the relevant commands to run.\n\nContinuous tests are run using Travis CI. Travis only runs foodcritic and chefspec; knife test is broken and test kitchen doesn't work with Travis. You are encouraged to run those tests on your own branch.\n",
